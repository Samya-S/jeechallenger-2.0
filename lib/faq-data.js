export const pyqFAQs = {
  questions: [
    {
      question: "Why are previous year questions important for JEE?",
      answer: "PYQs are crucial because they: 1) Reveal exam patterns and question trends, 2) Show frequently asked topics and weightage, 3) Help understand difficulty levels, 4) Improve time management skills, 5) Build confidence through familiar question types, 6) Highlight important concepts tested repeatedly. JEE Challenger provides 43 years of chapter-wise solved PYQs."
    },
    {
      question: "How many years of PYQs should I solve for JEE?",

    },
    {
      question: "Where can I get chapter-wise solved PYQs for free?",
      answer: "JEE Challenger offers free chapter-wise solved Previous Year Questions (PYQs) for all three subjects - Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. We provide Arihant's 41 Years and Disha's 41 Years collections with detailed solutions, organized chapter-wise for systematic practice."

    {
      question: "Should I solve PYQs year-wise or chapter-wise?",
      answer: "Solve chapter-wise PYQs during preparation phase to master each topic's pattern. Switch to year-wise solving during final months (3-4 months before exam) as full-length mock tests for time management and exam simulation. JEE Challenger provides both formats."
    },
    {
      question: "When should I start solving JEE previous year questions?",
      answer: "Start solving PYQs after completing each chapter's theory and basic practice problems. Don't wait until syllabus completion. Solving chapter-wise PYQs immediately after studying a topic helps reinforce concepts and identify weak areas early."
